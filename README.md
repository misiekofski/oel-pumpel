## üõ¢Ô∏è **Core Game Mechanics**

### **‚è∞ Time System**
- **1 week = 15 seconds** real-time
- **Manual advancement** - Use "‚è≠Ô∏è Next Week" button for faster play
- **Week counter** - Shows current game week and equivalent time

### **üí∞ Money Management**
- Earn money by selling oil at continent depots
- Spend on oil fields, ships, technology, and depot upgrades
- Higher-priced continents offer better profits

### **üõ¢Ô∏è Oil Production**
- Oil fields produce oil automatically every week
- Production = `Field Productivity √ó Technology Efficiency √ó 7 days`
- Upgrade fields to increase productivity by 30% ($1,000 each)

---

## üè≠ **Oil Fields System**

### **Buying Fields**
- **Cost increases** with each field: $2,000 + ($1,500 √ó number of fields owned)
- **Random productivity** between 0.5-2.0 barrels per day
- **Naming** - Fields are automatically named (Field 1, Field 2, etc.)

### **Upgrading Fields**
- **Cost**: $1,000 per upgrade
- **Effect**: +30% productivity (multiplicative)
- **Strategy**: Focus on upgrading high-productivity fields first

## üö¢ **Shipping & Fleet Management**

### **Ship Types Available**
| Ship Type | Capacity | Speed | Cost |
|-----------|----------|-------|------|
| Small Tanker | 1,000 | 1 week/distance | $8,000 |
| Medium Tanker | 2,500 | 1 week/distance | $20,000 |
| Large Tanker | 5,000 | 1 week/distance | $45,000 |
| Super Tanker | 10,000 | 1 week/distance | $100,000 |

### **Shipping Process**
1. **Select continent** in Oil Shipping panel
2. **Enter amount** to ship (limited by ship capacity and available oil)
3. **Ship departs** and travels for the continent's distance in weeks
4. **Oil delivered** to your depot at destination (if you have one)
5. **Ship returns** to your available fleet

### **Shipping Times by Continent**
- **North America**: 1 week ($45/barrel)
- **Europe**: 2 weeks ($55/barrel)
- **Asia**: 3 weeks ($65/barrel)
- **Africa**: 2 weeks ($50/barrel)

## üè≠ **Oil Depots System**

### **Building Depots**
- **Cost**: $5,000 per depot
- **Initial capacity**: 5,000 barrels
- **Required** for storing shipped oil
- **One per continent** maximum

### **Depot Management**
- **Capacity bar** shows storage level with color coding:
  - üü¢ **Green (0-70%)**: Good space available
  - üü° **Yellow (70-90%)**: Getting full
  - üî¥ **Red (90%+)**: Almost full, ships may wait!

### **Upgrading Depots**
- **Level 1**: 5,000 barrels (base)
- **Level 2**: +3,000 barrels for $5,000
- **Level 3**: +4,000 barrels for $8,000
- **Level 4**: +5,000 barrels for $11,000
- **Pattern**: Each level adds +1,000 more capacity than previous, costs +$3,000 more

### **Selling from Depots**
- **Manual selling**: Click "Sell All" to sell entire depot contents
- **Auto-sell**: Enable "Auto-sell when full" for automatic sales at 90% capacity
- **Revenue preview**: Button shows expected earnings before selling

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: If a depot is full, ships will wait and cannot unload until you make space!
